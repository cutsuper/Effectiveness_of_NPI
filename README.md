# Effectiveness_of_NPI
Worldwide, governments imposed a wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two years later today, pandemic fatigue has set in among the worldâ€™s population as the virus attack continues in waves. To help governments contain the pandemic more effectively and to ease the burden on the population, we examined the effectiveness of individual NPI among the 42 states in the US where death count exceeded 100 during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (February 1 to June 15, 2020). ![image](https://github.com/cutsuper/Effectiveness_of_NPI/assets/27043773/46b95c43-20ed-49e4-9410-b71c1d6272fe)
